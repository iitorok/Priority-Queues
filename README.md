# Priority-Queues
Developed three types of specialized priority queue ADTs.
First, I created a Binary PQ: a specialized version of the priority queue ADT implemented as a binary heap.
Secondly, I created a Sorted PQ: a specialized version of the priority queue ADT implemented with
an underlying sorted array-based container.
Thirdly, I created a Pairing PQ: a specialized version of the priority queue ADT implemented as a pairing
heap.
